# barometerDataCollection
An Android data collection app for mercury project

Two versions:

- The first version is developed under Android Studio 1.2 (in the folder androidStudio1.2).
- The second version is developed under Android Studio 2.1 (in the folder androidStudio2.1).

For some reasons the Android Studio 2 is not happy with the former version, that's why we have the second version.

In androidStudio2.1 version, we put the sensing part into a background service.
